    <h1>Bullshit Inventory</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      For the past three or so weeks I have kept a tally of the amount of bullshit I have encountered.
      I tracked what I saw as well as what I, or people I know, created. While this is by no means exhaustive,
      as tracking all bullshit would take a fair deal of work, this gives a look at just how much bullshit you
      find when you start looking and listening for it. Hover over the circles to see the shitty details.

      <h3>Literal Bullshit</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Since you started viewing this page there has been <strong><span id="timer">0</span></strong> lbs of literal bullshit created</p>
      <p>Now before you go and call bullshit on me for my bullshit counter, here are some facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amount of shit one cow creates per day: 65lbs</li>
        <li>Seconds in a day: 86400</li>
        <li>Total number of cows: about 1 billion</li>
        <li>Male to female cow ratio: about 1 to 1</li>
        <li>Bull to female ratio: about 1 to 25</li>
      </ul>
      <p>From that we get the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lbs of shit per second for one cow: 65lbs / 86,400s = 0.00075lbs/s</li>
        <li>Number of female cows: 5,000,000,000</li>
        <li>Number of bulls: 5,000,000,000 / 25 = 20,000,000 bulls</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And now putting it all together:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>0.00075lbs/s * 20,000,000 bulls = 15,000lbs/s!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So is the amount of bullshit created for this assignment actually 1? I will let you be the judge of that!</p>
